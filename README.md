# Car_Price_Prediction
This project Predicts the price of the cars
# 🚗 Car Price Prediction  

This project predicts the **selling price of cars** using **machine learning regression models**.  
It was developed as part of my learning in **data science and ML**, focusing on **data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model building**.  

---

## 📊 Problem Statement
Car buyers and sellers often struggle to estimate the right price of a vehicle.  
This project builds an ML model to **predict car prices** based on features like year, mileage, fuel type, brand, and other specifications.  

---

## 🚀 Features
- Data preprocessing (handling missing values, encoding categorical features).  
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with visualizations.  
- Model training with ML algorithms (Linear Regression, Random Forest, etc.).  
- Model evaluation with metrics such as R² Score, RMSE, MAE.  
- User input testing to predict car price.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Language**: Python  
- **Libraries**: NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- **Model**: Regression algorithms (Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, etc.)  
- **Dataset**: Car dataset (from Kaggle / custom dataset)
